proj1 = Rails 4 API
API developed to run in parallel with full-stack Rails application, for both internal and external consumption.  Renders HTML and XML for web application
and business partner access, JSON for Android and iOS mobile applications.
Other than the authentication & authorization modules, I built the majority of the endpoints, specifically alerts, codes, invitations, and patients.

proj2 = Rails 3
Surgical risk calculator, integrated into larger patient engagement portal. The surgeon selects a procedure, then makes a number of assessments about the patient's
health and medical history; answers to those questions are then run through an algorithm based on a dataset of ~500,000 surgeries to generate risk assessment and
percentile scoring.
I built nearly all the model files, and approximately half of the controller and views.
